# Zeno Website Redesign Plan

## Core Positioning Shift

**From:** "AI-powered dashboard tool for data storytellers"
**To:** "The easiest way to make your data look good"

### Key Messaging Pillars
1. **Simplicity** - As easy as Google Docs. No learning curve.
2. **Looking Good** - Impress your boss, teammates, customers
3. **Breadth** - Dashboards AND documents (not just dashboards)
4. **Speed** - Paste → Beautiful in seconds
5. **Shareability** - One link, anyone can view

## Section-by-Section Changes

### 1. HERO SECTION

**Current Issues:**
- "Beautiful dashboards in seconds" is dashboard-only
- "No spreadsheet skills required" is defensive rather than aspirational
- Mock preview is generic SaaS metrics
- "Data storytellers" doesn't resonate

**Proposed Changes:**

**New Headline Options (pick one):**
- "Make your data look amazing"
- "From messy data to beautiful in seconds"
- "Look good. Share fast."

**New Subheadline:**
"Paste your spreadsheet, upload a document, or connect Google Sheets.
Get a stunning dashboard or polished report you'll be proud to share."

**New CTAs:**
- Primary: "Try it free" (simpler, less commitment)
- Secondary: "See the magic" (leads to before/after)

**New Hero Visual:**
Replace generic metrics with a split-screen or transformation visual:
- Left: Messy spreadsheet / raw data
- Right: Beautiful polished output
- Animated transition between them (optional)

---

### 2. NEW SECTION: Before/After Transformation

**Purpose:** Prove the value instantly with visual evidence

**Structure:**
- Section title: "See the transformation" or "From this → to this"
- 2-3 interactive examples users can toggle between
- Each example shows:
  - BEFORE: Screenshot of raw data (spreadsheet, CSV, messy doc)
  - AFTER: The beautiful Zeno output

**Example Transformations:**
1. **Sales Report**
   - Before: Excel table with Q1-Q4 numbers
   - After: Clean dashboard with trend chart, key metrics highlighted

2. **Project Status Update**
   - Before: Bullet points in a doc
   - After: Visual status board with progress bars, timeline

3. **Marketing Campaign Results**
   - Before: CSV export from analytics
   - After: Polished report with charts, insights called out

**Implementation:** Tab interface or slider to toggle before/after

---

### 3. NEW SECTION: Who It's For

**Purpose:** Help visitors see themselves in specific use cases

**Section Title:** "Built for people who need to look good"

**Format:** Cards or tiles with role + use case

**Use Cases:**

1. **Sales Teams**
   - "Create stunning proposals and pipeline reports"
   - Icon: briefcase or chart-up

2. **Marketing Teams**
   - "Turn campaign data into shareable reports"
   - Icon: megaphone or bar-chart

3. **Finance & Operations**
   - "Make budget reviews and forecasts crystal clear"
   - Icon: calculator or pie-chart

4. **Founders & Executives**
   - "Impress investors with polished updates"
   - Icon: rocket or presentation

5. **Consultants & Freelancers**
   - "Deliver beautiful client reports without the overhead"
   - Icon: user or document

6. **Anyone with a Spreadsheet**
   - "Turn any data into something you're proud to share"
   - Icon: table or sparkles

**Tone:** Casual, relatable. These aren't enterprise personas - they're real people.

---

### 4. FEATURES SECTION - Updated

**Current Issues:**
- Too dashboard-focused
- "Data storytellers" language
- Some features feel technical

**Proposed Changes:**

**New Section Title:** "Why people love Zeno"

**Updated Feature Cards:**

1. **Paste anything**
   - "Spreadsheets, docs, CSVs, or just messy notes. We figure it out."

2. **Dashboards + Documents**
   - "Need charts? Get a dashboard. Have a report? We'll make it beautiful."

3. **AI that just works**
   - "Describe what you want in plain English. No formulas, no config."

4. **Share in one click**
   - "Get a link anyone can view. No logins required for them."

5. **Update anytime**
   - "New numbers? Refresh your dashboard in seconds."

6. **Look professional**
   - "Impress your boss, your clients, your investors. Every time."

---

### 5. HOW IT WORKS - Simplified

**Keep the 3-step format but update copy:**

**Step 1: "Bring your data"**
- "Copy-paste from a spreadsheet, upload a file, or connect Google Sheets"
- Visual: Multiple input sources flowing in

**Step 2: "Tell us what you need"**
- "Want a sales dashboard? A project summary? Just say so."
- Visual: Chat bubble with natural language

**Step 3: "Share something beautiful"**
- "Get a polished dashboard or document ready to share with anyone"
- Visual: Beautiful output with share button

---

### 6. TESTIMONIALS - Rework

**Current Issue:** Fake-sounding company names, "data storytellers" vibe

**Options:**

**Option A: Remove for now**
Since we don't have real customers, remove this section entirely until we do. Honesty > fake social proof.

**Option B: Replace with "What you'll hear yourself saying"**
Turn it into aspirational quotes from the USER's perspective:
- "My boss asked how I made this so fast"
- "Wait, I didn't have to learn anything?"
- "My client thought I hired a designer"

This feels more authentic and relatable than fake testimonials.

---

### 7. PRICING - Minor Updates

**Changes:**
- Remove "data storytellers" if present anywhere
- Clarify what "basic" vs "all" chart types means (or remove distinction)
- Add note: "Dashboards auto-refresh when connected to Google Sheets" (Pro feature)
- Keep it simple - pricing is fine as-is

---

### 8. FINAL CTA - Updated

**Current:** "Ready to transform your data?"

**Proposed:** "Ready to look good?"

**Subheadline:** "Join thousands of professionals who stopped fighting with spreadsheets. Start free, no credit card needed."

---

### 9. FOOTER - Clean Up

- Remove links that go nowhere (Blog, API, Changelog if empty)
- Keep: Features, Pricing, Privacy, Terms
- Add: Examples (once we have them)

---

### 10. OVERALL COPY TONE

**Remove:**
- "Data storytellers"
- "Data story"
- Anything that sounds enterprise-y

**Add more of:**
- "Look good"
- "Impress"
- "Beautiful"
- "Easy"
- "Seconds"
- "No learning curve"
- "Just paste"

**Voice:** Friendly, confident, simple. Like a smart friend showing you a cool tool.
