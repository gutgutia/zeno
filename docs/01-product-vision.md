# Zeno Product Vision

> **Paste data. Get a dashboard. Share in seconds.**

## Overview

Zeno is a platform that enables professionals to create beautiful, shareable dashboards from their data without any technical expertise. Think "Google Docs for dashboards" — simple, collaborative, and instantly shareable.

## The Problem

Professionals (consultants, marketers, founders, analysts) constantly need to share data insights with stakeholders. Current options are:

1. **Traditional BI Tools** (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI) — Expensive, complex, require database connections
2. **Spreadsheets** (Excel, Google Sheets) — Ugly, hard to share beautifully, not presentation-ready
3. **Manual Reports** (PowerPoint, PDF) — Time-consuming, static, outdated immediately

**The gap:** There's no simple way to go from "I have data" to "here's a beautiful, shareable dashboard" in minutes.

## The Solution

Zeno fills this gap with a radically simple workflow:

```
Paste/Upload Data → AI Generates Dashboard → Iterate via Chat → Publish & Share
```

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Zeno | Traditional BI | Spreadsheets |
|---------|------|----------------|--------------|
| Time to dashboard | Minutes | Days/Weeks | Hours |
| Technical skill required | None | High | Medium |
| Data connection needed | No (paste/upload) | Yes | No |
| Beautiful by default | Yes | Requires design | No |
| AI-powered iteration | Yes | No | No |
| Shareable with access control | Yes | Complex | Limited |
| Custom branding | Yes | Enterprise only | No |

## Target Users

### User Journey

1. **Discovery** — "I need to share this data beautifully"
2. **Signup** — Email magic link, instant access
3. **Create** — Paste CSV/Excel, AI generates initial dashboard
4. **Iterate** — Chat: "Make it a bar chart", "Add a filter by region"
5. **Publish** — One click, get shareable link
6. **Share** — Send to stakeholders, optionally restrict access
7. **Update** — Paste new data, dashboard updates (versioned)

## Product Principles

1. **Zero friction** — No database connections, no SQL, no design skills
2. **AI-first** — Chat is the primary interface for building dashboards
3. **Beautiful by default** — Every dashboard looks professional out of the box
4. **Share-native** — Built for sharing, not just viewing
